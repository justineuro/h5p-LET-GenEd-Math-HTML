## h5p-LET-GenEd-Math-HTML vs. h5p-LET-GenEd-Math
[h5p-LET-GenEd-Math-HTML](https://github.com/justineuro/h5p-LET-GenEd-Math-HTML) is similar in content to [h5p-LET-GenEd-Math](https://github.com/justineuro/h5p-LET-GenEd-Math).  However, here, the seven (7) H5Ps inlcuded in [h5p-LET-GenEd-Math](https://github.com/justineuro/h5p-LET-GenEd-Math)  (all of which are also included in this repository) were loaded into the [Lumi](https://app.lumi.education/) app and then exported as `HTML` as opposed to making them accessible by using [h5p-standalone v.3.7.0](https://github.com/tunapanda/h5p-standalone), as was done in [h5p-LET-GenEd-Math](https://github.com/justineuro/h5p-LET-GenEd-Math). Doing so, makes these H5Ps easier to view in a simple browser.
